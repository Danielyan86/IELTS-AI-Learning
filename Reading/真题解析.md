## C17.1.Test3

原文：
Charles Spencer’s latest book, To Catch a King, tells us the story of the hunt for King Charles II in the six weeks after his resounding defeat at the Battle of Worcester in September 1651. And what a story it is. After his father was executed by the **Parliamentarians** in 1649, the young Charles II **sacrificed one of the very principles his father** had died for and **did a deal with** the Scots, thereby accepting **Presbyterianism** as the **national religion** in return for being crowned King of Scots. His arrival in Edinburgh prompted the English Parliamentary army to invade Scotland in a pre-emptive strike. This was followed by a Scottish invasion of England. The two sides finally faced one another at Worcester in the west of England in 1651. After being comprehensively defeated on the meadows outside the city by the Parliamentarian army, the 21-year-old king found himself the subject of a national manhunt, with a huge sum offered for his capture. Over the following six weeks he managed, through a series of heart-poundingly close escapes, to evade the Parliamentarians before seeking refuge in France. For the next nine years, the penniless and defeated Charles wandered around Europe with only a small group of loyal supporters.

Charles II's father was executed by the Parliamentarian forces in 1649. Charles II then formed a
1 with the Scots, and in order to become King of Scots, he abandoned an important (2) that was held by his father and had contributed to his father's death. The opposing sides then met outside Worcester in 1651. The battle led to a
F for the Parliamentarians and Charles had to flee for his life. A （） was offered for Charles's capture, but after six weeks spent in hiding, he eventually managed to reach the
D of continental Europe.

这题没看懂，主要是上下文背景没有理清楚，然后有几个单词搞混淆了。选词题通常会出现一部分干扰选项，并且所填内容会被同义替换，不像从原文选词那么简单直接。

- 做题时候不要太着急，标题和每段首句还是要看的，特别是一下做不出来的时候，想这题刚开始没有看懂，就更应该从第一句开始看，因为本来也是针对第一段出的题。
- 整片文章其实是在讲关于‘To Catch King’这本书的看法，第一段其实在概括书的内容和起因。
- 整个剧情大概是茶丝王子爸爸被刀 -》为了继续当王子，和 Cots 达成交易-》放弃了原有什么教，接受了新的 p 教 -》 然后跑到 scot -》England 开始揍 scotland -》然后 scotland 又揍回去 -》最后双方在 west 决战 -》结果查丝还是失败了。起始剧情还是相当复杂和波折的，而且很多事情没有加上前因后果，加上一些生词，导致第一段相当难读，比如为什么他的爸爸为什么被刀？Parliament 为什么一定要弄死他？为什么他逃跑到 scot 立马就开打？有什么深仇大恨？
- 第一个空是最坑的，虽然很容易定位到了第一个空的内容应该是 did a deal with, 可是 deal 是什么，没法直接看出来，这个时候应该先看后面的。只有通过后面的打仗内容才能更确定这是一个军事联盟
- 第二空也不好直接填，找到了 sacrificed one of the very principles his father，并没有说这个 principle 是什么，这个时候再往后读发现这个王子接受了那个 Pre 教，所以内容应该是宗教信仰相关的- religious conviction
- opposing side 指的是交战双方，而不是单只对手方。
- a huge sum - 巨款
- evade 逃跑，结合 invade 记忆
- Parliamentarians adn Presbyterianism 是两个单词，不认识不要紧，当时是两个不同东西。

## commence

The scientist **commenced/started/began/initiated** the experiment with a detailed observation of the cells.

## appal

She was **appalled/shocked** by the lack of hygiene in the kitchen, finding it unacceptable for a professional restaurant.

original article spinet:
Charles’s adventures after losing the Battle of Worcester hide the uncomfortable truth that whilst almost everyone in England had been appalled by the execution of his father, they had not welcomed the arrival of his son with the Scots army, but had instead firmly bolted their doors. This was **partly because** he rode at the head of what looked like a foreign invasion force and partly because, after almost a decade of civil war, people were desperate to avoid it beginning again. This makes it all the **more interesting** that Charles II himself loved the story so much ever after. As well as retelling it to anyone who would listen, causing eyerolling among courtiers, he set in train a series of initiatives to memorialise it. There was to be a new order of chivalry, the Knights of the Royal Oak. A series of enormous oil paintings depicting the episode were produced, including a two-metre-wide canvas of Boscobel Wood and a set of six similarly enormous paintings of the king on the run. In 1660, Charles II commissioned the artist John Michael Wright to paint a flying squadron of cherubs carrying an oak tree to the heavens on the ceiling of his bedchamber. It is hard to imagine many other kings marking the lowest point in their life so enthusiastically, or indeed **pulling off** such an escape in the first place.

这段核心表达就是虽然老百姓对茶丝王子爸爸被害表示震惊，但是不喜欢茶丝王子和 scot 结盟，并紧闭大门，这因两个原因，一是 scot 看起来像国外入侵的部队，二是之前打了 10 年内战，老百姓有点怕了。中间那一大坨怎么纪念做做题来说并不重要，通常也不会出具体考点

- pull off

To pull off" is an English idiom meaning to successfully accomplish or achieve something, typically in the face of difficulty or challenge. In the given context, "pull off such an escape" implies that despite the escape being difficult or seemingly impossible, it was successfully executed.

- 背景知识补充：

```
在这段文本中，提到了“civil war”，指的是英国的内战，具体指的是 17 世纪英国的内战，通常指的是 1642 年至 1649 年间的英国内战，也被称为英国内战或英国大革命。这场内战是皇家党（支持国王查理一世）和议会派（支持议会）之间的斗争，最终以国王的失败和查理一世的处决结束。
```

如果文章刚开始介绍这个背景，整篇文章就好理解多了！所以刚开始是国内两党内斗，然后引入第三派 scot。

Charles Spencer is the perfect person to pass the story on to a new generation. His pacey, readable **prose** **steers deftly clear** of modern idioms and elegantly brings to life the details of the great tale. He has even-handed sympathy for both the fugitive king and the fierce republican regime that hunted him, and he succeeds in his desire to explore far more of the background of the story than previous books on the subject have done. Indeed, the opening third of the book is about how Charles II found himself at Worcester in the first place, which for some will be reason alone to read To Catch a King.
Charles Spencer

## prose 散文

## steer clear 避开

- Background knowledge supplement

charles 他是英国的一名贵族，也是戴安娜王妃的弟弟。他的全名是查尔斯·爱德华·莫里斯·斯宾塞（Charles Edward Maurice Spencer），他的爵位是阿尔瑟姆伯爵（Earl Spencer）

这里需要注意 charles 是作者，并不是指 charles 本人
题目：

- What does the reviewer say about Charles Spencer in the fifth paragraph?
  His decision to write the book comes as a surprise.
  He takes an **unbiased** approach to the **subject matter**.
  His descriptions of events would be better if they included more detail.
  He chooses language that is suitable for a twenty-first-century audience.

在这个上下文中，"subject matter" 意思是特定的主题或话题，例如书籍、文章或讨论中所涉及的内容。

The tantalising question left, in the end, is that of what it all meant. Would Charles II have been a different king had these six weeks never happened? The days and nights spent in hiding must have affected him in some way. Did the need to assume disguises, to survive on wit and charm alone, to use trickery and subterfuge to escape from tight corners help form him? This is the one area where the book doesn’t **quite hit the mark**. Instead its depiction of Charles II in his final years as an ineffective, pleasure-loving monarch doesn’t do justice to the man (neither is it accurate), or to the complexity of his character. But this one niggle aside, To Catch a King is an excellent read, and those who come to it knowing little of the famous tale will find they have a treat in store.

- tantalize

同义词，近义词: Tease, torment, seduce, entice, tempt💡
记忆方法： Imagine Tantalus trying to grab fruit always just out of reach, which is precisely the frustrating feeling when someone is being tantalised.
文中意思：逗引，引诱

- 题目：
  When the reviewer says the book "doesn't quite hit the mark", she is making the point that
  it overlooks the impact of events on ordinary people.
  it lacks an analysis of prevalent views on monarchy.
  it omits any references to the deceit practised by Charles II during his time in hiding.
  it fails to address whether Charles II's experiences had a lasting influence on him.

## religion background

长老会教派（Presbyterianism）：在苏格兰，查尔斯二世接受了长老会教派作为苏格兰的国教，这意味着国家将遵循长老会教派的宗教信仰和实践。

英国国教会（Church of England）：查尔斯二世的父亲，查尔斯一世，代表着英国国教会派别，这是英格兰的国教。

清教徒（Puritans）：在英国内战期间，清教徒在议会军队中占据了主导地位，他们倾向于更加严格和独立的宗教信仰，反对国王的教会权力。清教徒在一定程度上影响了政治和军事决策，并在对抗查尔斯二世的战斗中扮演了重要角色。

Known as the **Copper Scroll**, this curious document features letters chiselled onto metal - perhaps, as some have theorized, to better withstand the passage of time. One of the most intriguing manuscripts from Qumran, this is a sort of ancient treasure map that lists dozens of gold and silver caches. **Using an unconventional vocabulary and odd spelling**, it describes 64 underground hiding places that supposedly contain riches buried for safekeeping.

question:

1. The information on the Copper Scroll is written in an unusual way.

此题定位到 copper scroll 之后，实际和题干相对应的内容在后面，第三句了，前面的 metal 并不能完全确定。还有就是雅思阅读很不需要全部理解，这段内容大其余部分不好理解，但是没有设置考点！

He then travelled to the United States and **unsuccessfully offered** them to a number of universities, including Yale.

question:
In the early 1950s, a number of educational establishments in the US were keen to buy scrolls from Mar Samuel.

这题是 F。虽然没有明确提及 university 是不是 keen to buy，but 可以通过 unsuccessfully offered 推测为 false，NG 也是说的通的，这题个人觉得有点勉强了。
如果结合后面这段可能更能推测为 F
Finally, in 1954, he placed an advertisement in the business newspaper The Wall Street Journal - under the category 'Miscellaneous Items for Sale' - that read: 'Biblical Manuscripts dating back to at least 200 B.C. are for sale. This would be an ideal gift to an educational or religious institution by an individual or group.' Fortunately, Israeli archaeologist and statesman Yigael Yadin negotiated their purchase and brought the scrolls back to Jerusalem, where they remain to this day.

In 2017, researchers from the University of Haifa restored and deciphered one of the last untranslated scrolls. The university's Eshbal Ratson and Jonathan Ben-Dov spent one year reassembling the 60 fragments that make up the scroll. Deciphered from a band of coded text on parchment, the find provides insight into the community of people who wrote it and the 364-day calendar they would have used. The scroll names celebrations that indicate shifts in seasons and details two yearly religious events known from another Dead Sea Scroll.

question:
The scroll that was pieced together in 2017 contains information about annual occasions in the **Qumran** area 2,000 years ago.
这题是 true，可能是最难的一题。因为定位到 2017 之后发现 Qumran 在最后一段根本没有提到， 但是这题题干这么多内容，不大可能仅仅因为一个大写地名就 NG
pieced together -> restored
two yearly religious events -> annual occasions
annual 也可以表示年度的，所以和 two yearly 不冲突，这是第二个难点

  Setting aside such greats as Darwin and Einstein - whose monumental contributions are duly celebrated - we suggest that innovation is more a process of trial and error, where two steps forward may sometimes come with one step back, as well as one or more steps to the right or left. This evolutionary view of human innovation **undermines** the notion of creative genius and recognizes the cumulative nature of scientific progress.

question:
In the third paragraph, what do the writers suggest about Darwin and Einstein?

They represent an exception to a general rule.
Their way of working has been misunderstood.
They are an ideal which others should aspire to.
Their achievements deserve greater recognition.
盲猜也不大可能是 c 和 d，很多不太清楚的副词和名词不用纠结，考清楚考点就行了。关键在于 undermine 这个词起了否定作用。作者想表达这种进化论观点否定了创造性天才这种情况

  This simple law holds that **organisms** tend to repeat successful behaviors and to refrain from performing unsuccessful ones. Just like Darwin's Law of Natural Selection, the Law of Effect involves an entirely mechanical process of variation and selection, **without any end objective** in sight.

The Law of Effect states that no planning is involved in the behaviour of organisms.

- There was **only one** successful attempt to breed a thylacine in captivity, at Melbourne Zoo in 1899

Several thylacines were born in zoos during the late 1800s.

But it was not until 1929, with the species on the very edge of extinction, that Tasmania's Animals and Birds Protection Board passed a motion protecting thylacines only for the month of December, which was thought to be their prime breeding season.

There were still **reasonable numbers of thylacines** in existence when a piece of legislation protecting the species during their breeding season was passed.
题目说 with the species on the very edge of extinction， 而题干说的 reasonable numbers of thylacines。原文说句子结构比较复杂，意思也有点绕，但是其实和这次没有关系。
