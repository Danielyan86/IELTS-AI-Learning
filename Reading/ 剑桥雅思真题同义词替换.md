## sheer

"Sheer" comes from the Old English "scǣre," which meant clear, free from obstruction, and has roots in the Old Norse term "skǣr," meaning bright, clean. Over time, it came to be associated with something that is pure, unmixed and straightforwardly steep or abrupt in the form of cliffs or fabric.
The **sheer** scale of manufacture is so huge, that is the issue.
