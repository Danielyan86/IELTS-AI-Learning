Nowadays, an increasing number of people are concerned about the purpose of the university. Whether the university should prioritize providing job-related skills for the **- ** or more pure knowledge has caused a heated debate. My view is that universities should mainly focus on offering job-related knowledge and skills

First, the main objective for many students in pursuing a college education is to obtain a stable job after graduation to meet their personal and familial financial needs. This means that universities should primarily concentrate on equipping their students with practical skills to enhance their competitiveness in the job market

First, what the majority of students need most is work skills rather than pure knowledge.
First, what the workforce demands most are people with work-related skills rather than those with pure knowledge. If a company hires a person without work skills, it would take them more time to train that person, which leads to higher costs for the company.

Moreover, focusing on job-related skills can also benefit the college itself. For instance, AI technology **stands out** as one of the most **cutting-edge advancements** globally. If universities can **promptly adapt** and introduce AI-related courses, it will not only benefit their students in the job market but also enhance **operational efficiency** within the university itself

For instance, the innovation like chatGPT **stands out** as one of the most **cutting-edge advancements** globally

That is not to say the university should give up on pure or **theoretical** knowledge. Theoretical knowledge is the **foundational pillar** that supports practical skills . With a strong theoretical background, students can **grasp/acquire** practical knowledge more efficiently. However, the emphasis on theoretical knowledge should be balanced. This is because, for the majority of students seeking immediate employment after graduation, job-related skills hold greater significance than pure knowledge

It is important to learn the basic theoretical knowledge that can help students learn practical skills more quickly and understand them more deeply

In sum, the university should spend more time on developing job-related course to enhance their students' advantages in job market. Meanwhile, the theory knowledge of these practical skill also need to be **consolidated**. Only by balancing these two **approaches** can universities send more talents to society and the workforce.

Only by balancing the proportion of pure knowledge and job-related skills in university curriculum can universities send more talents to society and the workforce.
