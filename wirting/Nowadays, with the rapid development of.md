Nowadays, with the rapid development of globalization and transportation, an increasing number of professional choose to work in another country. Some people believe that they should be required in the country where they acquired training, while others argue that they can free to choice which country they want to work. My view is that offering more options for these professionals can benefit our own countries and others.

First, every individual's option should be respected which is the basis of our democracy and civilization society. No matter which country they choose, the country can get benefits from their expertise. If the these professionals such as doctors and engineers feel obliged to work in their own country, they cannot devote all energies to their duty.

Moreover, providing opportunities for these professionals to other countries can also benefits their own native countries. That is because these experts can learn new skills and get more working experiences when they work in other countries. If they come back to their own countries, these precious working experiences in turn benefit for the entities where they work.

That is not to say that we need to encourage all professional to work abroad. Because their own countries allocate much resources to foster them, such as providing necessary fund and equipments to train their skills, they need to serve for their own countries as turn. After they create more value or profit for their countries, these coutries can continue to utilize these resources to foster next generation, creating an excellent cycle.

In sum, allowing experts to work in other countries can bring more benefits for both their own countries and others. However, either of the ways should be based on respecting personal choice. Only by doing so, we can benefit most from this thing and construct a healthier and more outlook society.

Some people believe that they should be **required to work** in the country where they acquired training, while others argue that they should be free to choose which country they want to work in.

First, it is beneficial for these professionals to **have a wider range of career paths** to choose from. By having the freedom to select a country based on their background and professional goals, they can optimize their **career trajectory**.

This is because these experts can acquire new skills and **gain valuable work experience** while abroad. Upon returning to their home countries, they can apply these valuable experiences to benefit the organizations they work for

While it's important to provide opportunities for professionals to work abroad, it's also crucial to ensure that their own countries benefit from the investment made in their education and training. Many countries allocate significant resources to develop their workforce, including funding and equipment for skill development. As a result, professionals should be encouraged to serve their own countries after gaining valuable experience abroad. By contributing to the growth and prosperity of their home countries, these professionals can help create a positive cycle where resources are continuously reinvested to nurture the next generation of talent.

In conclusion, allowing experts to work in other countries can bring benefits to both their home countries and others. However, it's important that these decisions are based on respecting personal choice. Only by doing so can we maximize the benefits and create a healthier and more promising society.
