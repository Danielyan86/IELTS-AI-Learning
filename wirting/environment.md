## environment

First, it is **evident** that humanity's long-term activities have led to environmental damage and degradation. Both environmental protection and damage are **gradual** processes. Therefore, those who have contributed to this problem should take responsibility for finding solutions. Each of us should be aware of environmental issues and take steps to protect our environment.

Furthermore, every individual's daily activities have a significant impact on our environment. For example, using plastic bags and **disposable items** are harmful to our environment. If every citizen **adopts** a more environmentally friendly lifestyle, the environmental issues can be **mitigated/alleviate** to **some extent**.

That is not to say that the government and **huge companies** don't play a crucial role in environmental protection. In fact, the government and large companies can contribute significantly by **utilizing**/**pooling** their resources. The government can **enact laws** and promote environmental awareness **among citizens** to protect the environment. **Similarly**, large commercial entities can produce more 'green' products for people. However, all these **policies** and actions should be based on people's understanding

In summary, it is not appropriate to solve a **complex environmental problem** by adopting a single approach, such as the rising price of fuel.

## animal

First, it is not realistic to ban using animals since human's history is entwined with the history of using animal.
