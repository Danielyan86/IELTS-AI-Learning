With the development of living standard and medical technology, people are living longer than ever before. The question of that whether the increasing number of old people have more positive or negative effects has caused a heated debate. My view is that old people can definitely bring advantages to society and family by assigning some proper tasks to them.

Fist, old people accumulated more wisdom and experience from their life that can help their families and societies. For example, if a family have some old people, not only can they help to raise the children, but also can provide some useful parenting advices to young parents. Similarity, old people can offer some advices for the government or companies based on their experience.

Moreover, old people can still take some positions to continue to make contributions to the society. Some occupations in society do not require too much energy or advanced skills that are suitable for the old people. There are still significant number of old people working in various position, such as taxi driver, retailer etc.

That is not to say that old people do not pose challenges to our society and government. Old people require more heal care and convenient facilities, making more financial burden for the government. Meanwhile, they are more easily to get injured. However, I believe that these issues can be mitigated with the development of technology and economy.

In summary, old people can still contribute to their family and society if we face this issue positively and find proper solutions to address it. Anyway, all of us will become old, aren't we?

With the development of living standards and medical technology, people are **living longer than ever before**. The question of whether the increasing number of **elderly** people has more positive or negative effects has sparked a heated debate. My view is that elderly people can **undoubtedly** bring advantages to society and families by assigning them **appropriate** tasks.

First, elderly people have accumulated wisdom and experience **throughout** their lives that can benefit their families and societies. For example, **within** families, not only can they help to raise the children, but also can provide useful parenting advices to young parents. Similarly, elderly individuals can offer advice to governments or companies based on their **wealth of experience**.

Moreover, **elderly people** can continue to make contributions to society by taking on positions that do not require too much energy or advanced skills. Many occupations in society are suitable for older individuals. For example, there are still a significant number of elderly people working in various positions such as taxi drivers, retailers, and others.

That is not to say that elderly people do not pose challenges to our society and government. Elderly **individuals** require more **healthcare** and convenient facilities, placing a greater financial burden on the government. **In addition**, they are more **vulnerable/susceptible** to injuries, which implies they require more assistance from society or family. However, I believe that these issues can be mitigated with the development of technology and a **stronger** economy.

In summary, elderly people can still contribute to their families and society if we **approach** this issue positively and find proper solutions to address it. After all, **aging is a universal experience** that we will all go through eventually, isn't it?
