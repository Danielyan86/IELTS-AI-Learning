With the improvement of living standard and medical technology, increasingly people are living longer than ever before. Some hold that growing aging population poses a big challenging for governments, while others argue that more elderly people can benefit society in their own way. My view is that we can mitigate this problem as long as utilizing the elder resource properly.

First, the elder accumulate much social and life experiences from their past lives which can bring advantages for the society and family. For example, some young parents who do not have enough experience for parenting can get some advice from the elder of their family. Similarity, those who have rich work and management experience can bring some brilliant ideas for the company.

Moreover, the elder can continue to take some jobs to contribute the society. For example, they can work as taxi driver or saler in the store or supermarket which does not need high work skills. Taking some proper jobs not only gives more opportunities for young people to attend more creative work, but also contributes to the society.

That is not to say that the elder does not pose challenging to the society and government. The elder are more easy to get injury which can increase the medical fees for the society. And some of them lack the ability to live on their own, which also is a burden for their family.

In sum, the elder population is a challenging for our society, but they can continue to contribute to the society if we take some actions together. After all, everyone of us will become old ultimately.

## rewrite

With the improvement of living standards and medical technology, more and more people are living longer than ever before. Some argue that the growing aging population poses a big challenge for governments and societies, while others believe that more elderly people can benefit society **in various ways**. My view is that we can mitigate this problem by properly utilizing the resources of the elderly
We can mitigate this problem to some extent **as long as** we **approach** it positively and strive to find proper solutions to address it.

First, the **elderly** accumulate **a wealth of** social and life experiences from their past lives, which can bring advantages to society and families. For example, young parents who lack parenting experience can **seek** advice from the elders in their family. Similarly, those with rich **work and management experience** can contribute brilliant/innovative ideas to the companies as **consultants**.

Moreover, elders can continue to contribute to society by taking on roles that do not **require/demand** **excessive** physical exertion, such as taxi drivers or cashiers of convenience stores. By engaging in appropriate employment opportunities, they not only create space for young people to pursue more innovative work but also actively contribute to the community. Of course, these decisions should be based on their own choices rather than mandatory tasks.

Like a double-edged sword, the increasing elderly population also brings certain challenges. The elderly are more **prone to injuries**, which can increase **medical expenses/healthcare cost** for society. Additionally, some of them lack the ability to live independently, which can also be a burden for their families.

In summary, **elderly people** can still contribute to their families and society if we **approach** this issue positively and find proper solutions to address it. After all, **aging is a universal experience** that we will all go through eventually, isn't it?

## some examples

For example, seasoned investors like Warren Buffett can still offer valuable advice to investors worldwide even in his 90s.

## exertion

Completing the marathon required great **exertion** from all of the runners, who trained extensively for this challenge.
