This flowchart **illustrates** an overview of a domestic central heating system. It shows how the tank, boiler, and pipes **ensure** a constant flow of hot water to both radiators and taps throughout the **entire** house.

**First**, the cold water from the pipe and the storage tank on the roof enters the house. Both of them are pooled in a storage tank inside the house, ensuring a steady **reserve** of water for the whole house system. The storage tank is connected to a boiler, which can be used for heating the water via gas and oil. After the water is heated, one pipe from the storage tank is used to provide water for taps, and another one **channels** hot water to radiators by pump. The hot water from the radiators provides heat for the whole house through small tubes. Over time, the water temperature gradually decreases.

**Finally**, the water is circulated back to the boiler by a pump and heated again. Not only can this advanced heating system constantly provide water for the whole house, but it is also an environmentally friendly system for saving water

## rewrite

After the water is heated, one pipe from the storage tank provides water to the taps while another one channels hot water to the radiators. This hot water from the radiators is then circulated through small tubes, providing heat for the entire house. Over time, the water temperature gradually decreases. Finally, the water is pumped back into the boiler to be reheated.
