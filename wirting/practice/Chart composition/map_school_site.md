The two maps show the planned changed in the campus layout of Hogwards Grammar School from 2004 to 2010.

As can be seen from the figure 1, the school has 600 students in 2004 and there is only one school building located in the northwest of the map. In the center of the figure, there is a vast sports field which can be reached by a walking path from the school building. On the bottom of the map, there is a main road which can access to the Car park.

According the second figure 2, the shool will expand because the expected number students will reach to 1000 in 2010. The number of school buildings will rise to 3, each of them will be linked by a walking path. The School building 1 keeps the same location, but the area is smaller. On the left side, it locates the building 2 , and the building 3 is located below of it. Due to the expansion of the school buildings, the sports field is shrinking and moving a little towards to southeast. One more car park is added on the left side of the school building 1.

overall, more school buildings and car park are added to adapt the growth of students

The two maps show the planned changes in the **campus layout** of Hogwarts Grammar School from 2004 to 2010.

As can be seen from Figure 1, the school had 600 students in 2004, and there is only one school building located in the northwest of the map. In the center of the figure, there is a large sports field which can be reached by a walking path from the school building. At the bottom of the map, there is a main road that **provides** access to the car park.

According to Figure 2, the school will expand because the expected number of students will reach 1000 in 2010. The number of school buildings will rise to three, each of which will be linked by a walking path. School Building 1 remains in the same location, but the area becomes smaller. On the left side, Building 2 is located, and Building 3 is located below it. Due to the expansion of the school buildings, the sports field is shrinking and moving a little towards the southeast. One more car park is added to the left side of School Building 1, which **is linked** to the original park via the Main Road.

Overall, more school buildings and car parks are added to **accommodate** the growth of students.
