The line chart illustrate the percentage of urban population in four Asian countries, **spanning** fifty years from 1970 to 2020, and **includes predictions** for 2030 and 2040.
From 1970 to 2020, each country displayed a steady increase in their urban population. Malaysia, particularly, had the highest percentage throughout the years, starting initially around 29% in 1970 and rising dramatically to approximately 72% by 2020.

On the other hand, Indonesia had the lowest urban population in 1970, at just below 15%, but surpassed Philippines and Thailand in following years. By 2020, the percentage was the second highest of all countries, higher than Philippines and Thailand.

As for the predictions for 2030 and 2040, all countries are predicted to continue the upward trend. Malaysia still will be the hightest, reaching above 80% by 2040. The next following countries are Indonesia,Philippines and Thailand.

Overall, the graph demonstrates the urbanization develops very fast in these four Asia countries and this trend probably continue to increase until 2040.
