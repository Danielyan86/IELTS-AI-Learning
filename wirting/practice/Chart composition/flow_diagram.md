The two diagrams provide two **distinct/different** strategies for protecting houses in flood-prone areas.

In the first method, houses are constructed on **stilts** and are further protected by a stopbank. The stopbank is **placed** at the river bed, blocking direct water flow and preventing it from reaching the houses. Above the ground, the houses are built on stilts which further enhances their safety by keeping the main structure elevated from potential flood waters.

The second technique has similar initiatives, with the houses again built on stilts. However, the absence of flood barrier introduces the concept of 'freeboard'. It indicates an extra height, going above the level that a once-in-a-century flood might reach. With an additional 300mm, this 'freeboard' provides a safety buffer for the worst-case flooding scenarios.

Overall, these plans tackle the issue of flooding innovatively, with stilts being a common feature in both. The primary difference lies in either using flood barriers or creating additional height as a 'freeboard' to counter unpredictable and potentially destructive flood levels.
