# fee, higher cost of education, government

With the **continuous rise in prices**, the cost of higher education has also been increasing significantly in recent years.
Some people believe that the government should cover education fees, while others believe that students should pay their own tuition fees.

My view is that students should primarily bear the burden of tuition fees, while those from disadvantaged backgrounds can **receive assistance** from the government.

If all education costs are covered by the government, students may **take everything for granted** and **not study as hard**, **resulting in a waste of** educational resources

If students can pay their own tuition fees, it can **lessen/reduce the financial burden** on the government.
The government also faces many challenges, such as an **aging society**, environmental protection, and **people's welfare**, all of which require strong financial support

If the government allocates too much money as well as other resources for higher education, other programs may not **receive enough support**

In addition, setting up scholarships is also an effective **assistance measure**, as it not only reduces the financial burden on students but also encourages them to **study harder**.

In summary, for the majority of students, it is necessary to bear their own tuition fees, while the government should provide appropriate financial assistance for those students with poor conditions.

In addition to direct financial support, we can also offer various other forms of assistance, such as setting up scholarships

By adopting various measures based on different scenarios, we can **tailor more effective solutions** to address these problems
**Subsidizing living expenses** is a more effective method than covering tuition fees

**In addition to** direct financial support, we can adopt various measures **tailored/customized** to different scenarios, **thereby** making assistance for students **from disadvantaged** backgrounds more effective.
