## trade

with the development of economy and trade, an increasing number of people are buying products from other countries.
In my opinion, this development brings about more **benefits** than **drawbacks**.

- 价格对消费者有利
  Importing products from other countries is beneficial for consumers because it lowers the cost of living by allowing them to **purchase/buy** cheaper products.

By **utilizing/pooling** their advantages of technology or geography, the exporting countries have the ability to control the cost of exporting products.

In addition, exporting more products from other countries leads to fiercer commercial competition, **forcing/driving** more local companies to lower their product prices or improve their technology. For example, when China imported the famous electric car brand - Tesla into the local market, it **prompted/triggered/stimulated** more local car companies to upgrade their technology

In turn, consumers' disposable income increases as they purchase cheaper products.

- 更多的选择

Moreover, there are more options for the consumers when they go shopping.

In the past, consumers were unable to purchase certain **goods** locally **due to various reasons/factors** such as geographic locations , high prices or natural disaster.

By importing goods from all around the world, people can improve their living standard.

however, like a coin has two sides, importing products also has some negative impact on society.
If a country relies too heavily on importing products, it may **undermine its own industrialization**
Transporting products over long distances can lead to environmental damage, as transportation tools such as cars, planes, and ships **emit/release** **large amounts of** carbon dioxide

In summary, **while** importing goods **presents/brings** environmental and commercial challenges, it improves our living standards and **drive/propels** local companies forward. If we can **address these challenges** more positively and tailor corresponding solutions to mitigate them, we will benefit more from global trade in the future."
