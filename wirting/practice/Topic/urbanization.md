With the rapid development of urbanization, an increasing number of people are moving from rural areas to cities.
My view is that urbanization is a positive trend, despite the challenges it brings during the process.
Compared to the many job opportunities in cities, people from rural areas have limited job options because the rural economy mainly relies on agriculture.

Like a coin has two sides, **the influx of a huge number of people** into cities also brings some challenges for the government and society

As long as we **approach these challenges** positively and **take proactive steps to mitigate them**, we can **optimize the benefits of urbanization.**

In conclusion, urbanization is generally a positive trend, as it offers increased job opportunities and access to public facilities for the majority of people.
