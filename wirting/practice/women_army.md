Nowadays, an increasing number of countries start to open the door of army for women due to human resource shortage. However, the question of whether the army solely needs males has caused a heated debate. My view is that female individuals still have the equal right to join the army, but it should not be a mandatory task.

First, some countries are facing the human resource shortage issues which might be caused by previous war or low birth rate. If the government can open doors of army for women, this issue can be mitigated in some extent.

Moreover, some army positions are more suitable for the women. For example, the army have a hight demand for the nursery position which requires more patient and less dangerous than the position in front line. If women have the opportunity to join the army and take these positions, they can use their advantages to serve their army and country.

That is not to say that we should force women to join or serve in army. Whether joining army or not should base on their own choice. If a female individual is forced to join an mary, they can not devote all their energy into their jobs. So, we have to respect everyone's decision, including women, that is the basis of constructing a healthy army and society.

In summary, the government should provide equal access for women to join the army. But all these policy and steps should obey their own willing. Only by doing so, we can not only utilizing female advantages for army , but also constructing a more healthy army and society.

First, some countries are experiencing human resource shortages, **stemming/result from** past conflicts or **declining birth** rates. By opening the doors of the **military** to women, the government can mitigate this issue to some extent. Similarly, women have more **career options** available to them.

By opening the doors of the military to women, not only can the human resource shortage problem be mitigated, but women also have more career options. It is a win-win strategy.

Moreover, **certain** positions within the army are **better suited** for women who are more patient and understanding. For example, roles such as high-demand **nursery** positions require more patience and **involve less risk** compared to **frontline positions**.

In summary, the government should provide equal access for women to join the army. However, all policies and steps should respect their own **willingness/preferences**. **By doing so**, we can not only utilize the advantages of females in the army but also build a **healthier army and society**
