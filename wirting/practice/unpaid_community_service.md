Nowadays, an increasing number of high school students starts to attend some community service as volunteers. The question of whether the unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes has caused a heated debate. My view is that attending some unpaid community services benefits both for students and communities, but that should not be a compliance task for students.

Students can improving their social skills and communications skills through attending community services. As most students would find a job after graduation, it's essential for them to know how to communicate and provide service with people of society. Most community service work need to interact with people, so it is one of the most effective approaches to improve their communication skills.

Communities and societies can also get some benefits from students' service. For example, working for a charity can mitigate the shortage of labor; improving the neighborhood can optimize our living standard; and teaching sports to younger children can trigger their passion for sports.

Although attending community brings significant benefits for students, that is not to say that it should be assigned as a compulsory task for students. Because if a student feels it's a burden for him, he can't devote all his energy into this task and the result of this task may not meet our expectation.

In summary, attending community can benefit both for the societies and students. However it should not be assigned as a compulsory task for students. If the students feel encouraged and inspired to do the community service as volunteers, this task would be have a more profound effect for our society.
