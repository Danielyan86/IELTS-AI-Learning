## 多选题

Young man: With those protesting workers called the Luddites destroying their knitting machines because they were so worried about losing their jobs.

Young woman: Yes, and ultimately, **they didn’t achieve anything**. And anyway, industrialisation created more jobs than it destroyed.

Young man: Yes, that’s true – but it probably **didn’t seem a positive thing at the time**. I can see why the Luddites felt so threatened.

- 题干
  Which TWO opinions about the Luddites do the students express?
  Their actions were ineffective.
  They are still influential today.
  They have received unfair criticism.
  They were proved right. -如果知道 luddites 的背景，就知道不可能是这个选项
  Their attitude is understandable.

第一个很好选，第二个没有那么明显，yes 是肯定的 industrialisation created more jobs than it destroyed.
这题用排除法好做些，一旦确定态度，c 和 d 基本排除
I can see why -> I can understand
lower unemployment -> unemployment will fall
productivity -> efficient
higher disposable -> earning power has gone up

## 选项中多了一修饰词

C. administration offices.
c 不是 answer

##

**They can only be approached by sea**, but if you feel that you want to see more than we're able to show you, then you can take a kayak into the area on **another day and one of our staff** will give you more information on that.
What we'll do is **to go through a narrow channel**, past some incredible rock formations and from there we'll be able to see the openings to the caves,

- Which TWO points does Lou make about the caves?

Only large tourist boats can visit them. F 小船才行
The entrances to them are often blocked. F channel 可以过去，只是更多小洞子之类不能去
It is too dangerous for individuals to go near them. NG
Someone will explain what is inside them.  
They cannot be reached on foot. 最后一个答案先出现

- Which TWO types of creature might come **close** to the boat?
  sea eagles
  fur seals
  dolphins
  whales
  penguins

注意题干的修饰词，close，推测 eagles，whales 这种也不会接近 boat 这种小船的

- What happened when Diana was working with dairy cows?
  She identified some cows incorrectly.
  She **accidentally** threw some milk away.
  She made a mistake when **storing** milk.

But I got mixed up,and I poured some milk from the wrong cow in with the milk for humans,so the whole lot **had to be thrown away**. The farmer wasn't too happy with me.
y
因果关系没有搞清楚，不小心把牛奶分类搞错导致 mike 被到出去，而不是不小心到了

- What did the students learn about adding supplements to chicken feed?

##

These should only be given if specially needed.
It is worth paying extra for the most effective ones.
The amount given at one time should be limited.

And he didn't give them as a matter of routine,just at times when the chickens seemed to particularly require them.

particularly-> specially
only-> just
require -> need

Yes,mine said the same. He said certain breeds of chickens might need more supplements than the others,but the cheap and **expensive ones are all basically the same.**

##

原文：
Yes, we do. The next walk is to Ruston Island, a week on Saturday. We'll be meeting in the car park at Dunsmore Beach at low tide – that’s when the **sands** are dry enough for us to **walk to the island** without getting wet.
题目

- walk across the sands and reach the **island**
  题目中并没有提到 dry，原文中也没有 and 这样的结构,并且原文的 walk to 接的又是 island，和题目也不好直接 map。需要把整句话听完并理解才好填

reach -> walk

##

They used to be jet black, but our new ones now have these comfortable dark red **seats** and a light-green **exterior** in order to stand out from others and help promote our company.

red 后面接的是 seats，需要把三个颜色听完

- question
  What colour are the tour boats?
  dark red
  jet black
  light green

##

- Which TWO features of the lighthouse does Lou mention?

why it was built
who built it
how long it took to build
**who staffed it** 谁在那里工作 -> who are working here
what it was built with

##

- original

Well, we have several activities specially for children, like dressing up in the sorts of clothes that children wore in the past,

and as it's a fine day, some of you will probably want to play in the adventure playground.

Our **latest** addition is child-sized tractors, that you can drive around the grounds.

- What is new for children at Oniton Hall?
  clothes for dressing up
  mini tractors
  the adventure playground

原文其实三个答案都提到了，只有 tractor 前面加了 latest，稍微不注意就漏掉了！预判每个题目考查重点和可能出现干扰项

## 双重否定句

- I didn't dislike it. It helped to change the mood of the quieter scenes.

碰到这种题认栽，双重否定，所以要找肯定答案，而不是否定

- 题干 they disagree about why this is an issue.
  题目理解有问题，题目是他们在这个问题的**原因上没有达成一致**，而不是他们不同意这为什么是一个问题
  看到 disagree 立刻想到意见不一致

##

- original text

Yeah, and they can also be **understood** on **different levels**. The characters have such depth.

questions:
Why do the students think Shakespeare's plays have such international appeal?
The stories are exciting.
There are recognisable characters.
They can be interpreted in many ways

understood -> interpreted
different level -> many ways

这题有点难，考的两个同义替换，提到 characters 直接选反而会错

## such as -> think about

such as 不一定是 for example

## smartphones 是一个单词

watch TV or films, play games, listen to music, and so on. Obviously, this is a good thing in many respects because it promotes their **bilingual** skills,

• are becoming 1 very quickly

##

A: That should be fine. And some of them are in a frame - should I take them out before I send them?

B: Yes please, we can't copy them otherwise. And also the photos must all be separate, they mustn't be stuck into an album.

题干:
Photos must not be in a (1) or an album.
frame 和 ablum 并没有直接作为并列结构在原文出现，并且 must not 是通过对话形式否定的。更坑的是如果听到了 must be 这样的词后其实不是答案，不过这种题不是很多

##

We charge £195 for 300 to 400 photos for the basic service.

题干： The cost for 360 photos is (195) （including one disk).
195-> a hundred and ninety-five 注意和常规读法不太一样

##

That's good. So do I **need** to pay when I send you the photos?
「17」
No, we won't need anything until we've actually copied the pictures.
「18」
Then we'll let you know how much it is, and once we've received the **payment**, we'll send the parcel off to you.

Before the completed order is sent, （） is required.

require 和他的同义替换并没有直接出现答案附近，before 也要同义替换，order 也要同义替换，要前后理解三句话，对于 part1 来说相当坑了
不过就所填内容来说，如果没听太懂，也只能猜 payment 和 parcel 两个词

##

The lower school will move to new buildings that will be constructed on the main site.
「13」
Developers will construct **houses** on the existing lower school site.
「14」
Work on the new school buildings should start within the next few months.
「15」
A more imminent change concerns the catering facilities and the canteen.

- What is planned with regard to the lower school?

All buildings on the main site will be improved.
The lower school site will be used for new **homes**.
Additional school **buildings** will be constructed on the lower school site.

houses -> homes
2,3 核心区别在于新加房子是学校还是住宅，houses 通常是指住宅，不能**直译成房子**。并且这个 house 并有说是 shool 相关的建筑,new 在第二个选项是干扰词汇，因为之前是学校，只要新修的建筑其实都是 new。
其实第三句也可以写成 the lower school site will be used for additional school buildings，雅思就是喜欢把同一个意思翻来覆去改增加理解难度

##

analysed a group of women who were Zumba regulars and found that a class lasting 40 minutes burns about 370 calories.
「33」
This is similar to moderately intense exercises like step aerobics or kickboxing.

question:
A study at The University of Wisconsin showed that doing Zumba for 40 minutes uses up as many () as other quite intense forms of exercise.

这种题比较坑，提到 intense exercises 时候，其实答案在前面，对这题来说数字是干扰，但是做题时候仍然可以写下 370 calories

##

study in the American Journal of Health Behavior showed that when women with obesity did Zumba three times a week for 16 weeks,

women suffering from （1）
with->suffer from

##

More importantly, the **women** enjoyed the class so much that they made it a **habit** and continued to attend classes at least once a week - very unusual for an aerobic exercise programme.

-Zumba became a ()for the participants.

##

The **subjects** were unaware of what they were drinking.
subject 表示被测试对象，也就是 people
