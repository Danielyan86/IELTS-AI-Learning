One actor whom I greatly admire is Leonardo DiCaprio, and a character of his that left a lasting impression on me is Jack from the film "Titanic." I first saw the film at cinema in 1997

In "Titanic," Jack is portrayed as a spirited young artist who wins a ticket onto the ill-fated Titanic during a poker game. Despite coming from humble beginnings, Jack possesses remarkable enthusiasm for life and a genuine kindness that resonates with audience

What I really like about Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of Jack Dawson is how he brings depth and sincerity to the character. Jack's unwavering optimism and belief in love and human connection, even in the face of tragedy, make him a truly memorable character. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance captures Jack's spirit and resilience in a way that feels genuine and heartfelt.

Beyond his performance in "Titanic," I admire Leonardo DiCaprio for his versatility as an actor and his dedication to his craft. He consistently delivers nuanced and emotionally resonant performances across a diverse range of roles。

Moreover, I deeply respect Leonardo commitment to environmental activism and his efforts to raise awareness about climate change and environmental conservation. He uses his platform and influence to advocate for urgent action on pressing global issues.

In summary, Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of Jack Dawson in "Titanic" showcases his exceptional talent as an actor, and his dedication to important social and environmental causes makes him someone whom I truly admire and respect.

The film character I'd like to talk about is Jack Dawson, who was brilliantly played by Leonardo DiCaprio in the iconic film "Titanic". This epic romance and disaster film was released in 1997 and I remember seeing it for the first time in the early 2000s when I was a teenager.

In the film, Jack is depicted as an artist and a vagabond. Despite his humble background, his enthusiasm for life and his charming personality made him a very memorable and well-liked character. he wins a ticket in a poker game to the luxurious Titanic. Once on board, he meets and eventually falls in love with Rose, a young woman from the first-class cabin played by Kate Winslet.

What stands out about Jack is his warmth, courage, and **unyielding spirit**. Despite the huge socio-economic differences between himself and Rose, he displays his deep love for her without fear or hesitation. He is a respectful, enthusiastic, and passionate young man.

I have immense respect and admiration for Leonardo DiCaprio because of his convincing portrayal of Jack Dawson. Not only was he able to portray the character's charming and roguish side, he also deeply incorporated the aspects of fearlessness and fierce love into his role. It wasn’t just a character, for the duration of the movie, he WAS Jack. The strength of his performance makes it hard to imagine anyone else in this unforgettable role.

The sport that I have only watched before but haven't tried myself is hurdling.
Hurdling is a very difficult **event** in **track and field** that requires highly specialized skills. It is a race in which athletes need to cross 10 hurdles within a 110-meter distance. I remember it was during the Summer Olympic Games held in Greece in 2004. The Chinese athlete Liu Xiang participated in the Olympic Games for the first time, and at last, he won a **gold medal**. I watched the final match at home with my dad. Due to the time zone difference, it was in the middle of the night in China. Before that, no Chinese or Asian athlete had ever won the hurdling event. It was a very thrilling match. Afterward, my dad and I were so excited that we couldn't sleep at that night

Although I haven't met him in real life, reports and his autobiography suggest that he is humble and dedicated to his sport. Despite facing immense pressure as a high-profile athlete, Liu Xiang has always shown remarkable calmness and resilience, especially when dealing with injuries and setbacks
