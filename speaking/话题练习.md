are you good at memorize things?

What do you need to remember in your daily life?
I need to remember to check my mail on a daily basis, to make sure I don't miss some important information from work

- How do you remember important things?
  I use the app on my phone to help me remember important things. I set it as a reminder before they happen.

I like **public service advertisements**. Because they encourage citizens to do **meaningful** things for society."
