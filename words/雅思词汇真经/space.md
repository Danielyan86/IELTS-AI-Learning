1. As the comet **streaked** across the night sky, it collided with Earth's atmosphere, fragmenting into smaller pieces known as **meteorites** that **plummeted** towards the surface, leaving behind a trail of fiery **streaks** before crashing into the ground, leaving a gaping **crater** as a lasting reminder of its celestial journey.

   To remember "meteorite," consider the image of a "meteor" taking an "exit" from the sky and landing on Earth â€” hence a rock that has come from the sky "meteor" + "ite" for the rock form found on Earth.

   To recall "crater," imagine a large bowl-shaped "crater" on the moon's surface as if someone had placed a giant mixing bowl there, leaving a distinct impression.
