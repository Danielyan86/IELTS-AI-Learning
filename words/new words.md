## depletion

The word "deplete" comes from the Latin "deplere," which is formed by combining "de-" (completely) with "plere" (to fill). Thus, originally, it meant "to empty out." When you deplete something, you are emptying it of its contents, leading to the modern sense of using up resources or reducing in number.
词根词缀拆解: "De-" means "completely" or "thoroughly," and "plere" means "to fill," so "deplete" effectively means to thoroughly empty.
同义词，近义词: Exhaust, drain, consume, diminish
记忆方法： Consider the "de-" prefix meaning "reverse of" or "away from" and "plete" similar to "plenty." To deplete is to move away from plenty, or to use up a plentiful supply until there's little or nothing left.

💡 记忆方法： Associate 'procurement' with the process of 'pro- (forward)' 'cure-(gathering or obtaining)', meaning 'gathering upfront or in advance' which aligns with the meaning of procurement.
